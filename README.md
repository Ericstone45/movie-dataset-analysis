Movie Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project explores a movie dataset containing information such as budget, revenue, genres, popularity, runtime, production companies, and more.
The goal is to analyze the data, handle missing values, and discover meaningful insights about the film industry.

📂 Dataset Information

Source: [Movie dataset from Kaggle / TMDb / Other]

Size: ~45,000+ rows

Key Columns:

budget – production cost of the movie

revenue – earnings of the movie

genres – categories the movie belongs to

runtime – length of the movie

popularity – audience interest score

vote_average – average rating

production_companies – companies that produced the movie

release_date – when the movie was released

🔧 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values in budget, revenue, runtime, etc.

Removed duplicate rows.

Converted release_date into datetime format.

Processed genres and production_companies into structured format.

📊 Key Questions Explored

Which movies had the highest revenue?

Does higher budget always mean higher revenue?

Which genres are most popular?

How does runtime affect ratings?

What trends exist in movie releases over time?

📈 Tools & Libraries Used

Python 🐍

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

NumPy – numerical operations

Jupyter Notebook – for analysis

🚀 Insights (Example)

Action and Drama are the most common genres.

Budget and revenue are positively correlated, but not always proportional.

Movies between 90–120 minutes get the best ratings.

Popularity does not always equal high ratings.

📌 Future Work

Apply machine learning to predict revenue from budget, genres, and popularity.

Perform sentiment analysis on movie taglines.

Build a dashboard for interactive exploration.
